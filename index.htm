<h1>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.</h1>
<h1>Hint:(If you want to think and act like a programmer, then you can inspect the code and my console. To do that, just click with your middle finger and your pointer finger, if you are on Macbook. If on Windows, then right click. Then click on Inspect. After that, go to Console for output.)</h1>
